# The Big idea
My parents want me to workout a designated number of times a week. This number is 4. Two times on the weekend, and two times during the workweek. The issue here is that I don't always do that. I need to come up with a solution. 

## The issue

I need to workout 4 times a week. I do not. 
### My Solution
The first idea hinges upon my school week being mostly planned out. It typically is, at least till Thursday. If I were to look at this calendar on Monday and identify 2-4 days in which I have a low enough amount of schoolwork I could workout and be prepared ahead of time, that would be ideal. 

Lets get more into the nitty gritty of this. Here's what a Monday would look like for me... 
- Get up
- Go to school
- Look at my calendar in second block (first block teacher is always very picky with Chromebook)
- Determine which days I would have time enough to workout 
- If that number of days is more than two, determine if I want to workout three or four times over the week rather than workout over the weekend (for scheduling reasons)
- Text my parents about what days I intend to workout
- Once approved, mark those days as "NOT AVALIABLE" so I don't accidentally go socializing until 7pm and run out of time to workout. 
- Any event falling on the day of a scheduled workout that I would like to attend must be brought up to the family at least 24 hours before the scheduled workout and a makeup day must be discussed, otherwise I simply won't go to the social event.
