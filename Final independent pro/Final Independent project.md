For my final project, I want something very dark. I want it to be cryptic and evocative. I want more questions about why I made it than how. I'm thinking a dark centerpiece that while of a similar color to the background, still strands out. The piece will also include some sort of phrase. Something that makes you uncomfortable from how many ways it can be taken as a question. Is it meant maliciously? Is it meant genuinely? I want the question or phrase to invoke enough questions about how it's meant that you begin thinking about what your own answer means. Below are images I'd like to draw reference from.

As you can (hopefully) see, these images are lovely pieces of art I'd like to mimic in one way or another. However, I need to choose a source image. Lets do that.
