# Independent clauses
Independent clause - A fancy way to say "complete sentence"
How to know if something's an independent clause - ask yourself "is this a complete sentence?"

 - Read the sentence with the blank. Where does the independent clause end

FANBOYS - for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so
A colon can only come after an independent clause

###### If independent clauses can be joined with a semicolon, or a comma and a FANBOYS word, how do you know when to use which?
- This comes down to the answer choices themselves. The SAT will never give you two answer choices that could work. 
##### Helpful tip
- Since no two answer choices can be right simultaneously, when you see two answers that perform the same function within a sentence, they can automatically be ruled out as a answer. 
EX - 
 **ADD AN EXAMPLE HERE**

##### Try it - 
Ganymede is the largest of Jupiter's moons. It is one of the largest objects in the solar BLANK in fact, it is larger than Mercury and Pluto.

Provide an example of things that could fill in this blank. 

Possible answers - 
- System;
- system, and


### Helpful tip 
- Since no two answer choices can be right simultaneously, when you see two answers that perform the same function within a sentence, they can automatically be ruled out as a answer. 
EX - 
 **ADD AN EXAMPLE HERE**



# Dependent clause 

A dependent clause is an independent clause with one of the following words...
- since though if because even if un less while that as when in order to although
Dependent clauses cannot stand alone 

### Independent to dependent 

Ind - They wanted to watch a movie
Dep - Because the wanted to watch a movie

Ind - It was hot out 
Dep - Since it was hot out
