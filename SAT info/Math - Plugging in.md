# Plugging in basic approach

1. Identify the variable(s)
2. Plug in a number for the variable(s)
3. Work through the steps of the problem
4. Circle the target value
5. Plug into all four answers, eliminating any that do not match the target value

### In normal terms

1. There's an equation just below the instructions. Plug some easy mf numbers in for the variables. 
2. Work through the problem and determine the answer to the top equation with the numbers you plugged into for the variables
3. Plug in the same numbers you used for the variables into the equations in the answer choices. The one that works out to the same value you located in step 2 is your answer. 

### How to know if you can plug in 

- The question asks about a relationship between variables or numbers
- There are variables in the answer choices
- The question asks for an "equivalent expression"
- The question includes the phrase "in terms of"

### What to plug in 

- Small, simple numbers
- A number that would set denominators equal to one
