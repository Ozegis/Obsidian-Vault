# Basic approach in a vocab setting

1. Read the text and determine WHO or WHAT the blank is referring to
2. Highlight clues in the sentence that describes the person or thing
3. Watch out for transition words that may change the direction of the sentence "but", "However", etc
4. Choose a word the blank would most likely be filled in with given the context of the sentence
5. Choose the answer choice most similar to your chosen word
6. Watch out for traps. The most common traps on the vocab portion are Opposite, Recycled language, and Beyond the text
Example - 
	With its iridescent and seemingly balloon-like features, the metallic sculpture Rabbit by artist Jeff Koons might appear like a fantastic rendering from a child's imagination, but in 2019 it was sold for the ________ price of $91 million, making it the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction by a living artist.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

A - Creative
B -Bizarre
C - Economical
D - Astronomical

1. Read the text and determine WHO or WHAT the blank is referring to
2. Highlight Clue phrase
	"sold for the ________ price of $91 million"
3. Watch out for transition words
	None here
4. Choose a word that would fit the sentence 
	"very high"
5. Use the word you think would be optimal in the blank and look for an answer choice most similar to it. 
	Word - Very high
	A - No
	B - Maybe
	C - No
	D - Yes

It seems to me that with vocab questions, the main idea behind them is getting a good base word. What word do you know that could fit into the question well?
