### Way to solve 
1. Read the question
2. Identify Question type
3. Read the text with the question in mind
4. Highlight what will help answer the question
5. Use Process of elimination

Example -
1. Read
	According to the text, why did Kraemer and his team suggest that high-skill gamers were more excited at the start of the game?
2. What question type? 
	Retrieval BECAUSE - "According to the text," 
3.  Read the text
	In 2016, researcher William J. Kraemer and colleagues at The Ohio State University looked to establish a link between competitive electronic gaming and physiological stress responses. Kraemer and his team chose 32 participants of both high and low skill levels to participate in an online game and monitored their heart rates continuously throughout the game. The researchers noted that while the high-skill players began the game with an elevated heart rate that only rose slightly throughout the course of the game, low-skill players exhibited a normal heart rate at the start of the game that increased dramatically as the game progressed. This led Kraemer and his team to hypothesize that while high-skill gamers may be more excited at the start of the game, they are not as stressed by the events of an online game as low-skill gamers are.
4. Highlight what can help
	"The researchers noted that while the high-skill players began the game with an elevated heart rate that only rose slightly throughout the course of the game, low-skill players exhibited a normal heart rate at the start of the game that increased dramatically as the game progressed. This led Kraemer and his team to hypothesize that while high-skill gamers may be more excited at the start of the game, they are not as stressed by the events of an online game as low-skill gamers are."
5. Use process of elimination 
	Because the low-skill gamers were already too stressed at the start of the online game to play competitively 
		No, We don't know that the low skill gamers were already stressed 

	Because the high-skill gamers had a higher initial heart rate than did the low-skill gamers 
		Yes, its consistent with the increased heartrate detailed in the text
	
	 Because the high-skill gamers knew their experience would give them an edge over the low-skill gamers 
		No, the text never directly mentions the experience or an edge
	
	Because the high-skill gamers played with superior connection speeds compared with those Of the low-skill gamers
		No, text doesnt mention superior connection speeds
## Process of elimination in a nutshell

-  Beyond the text - coujld be true but not supported by text
- Right answer, wrong question - in text, but doesnt answer question
- Half right - Half correct but half not
- Opposite - Direct opposite from text 'Not'
- Extreme language - "always or never language" Not always the case
- Recycled language - Something that reuses words from texts in the wrong context
