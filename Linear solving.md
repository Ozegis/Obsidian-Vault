When Plugging in numbers and plugging in answers don't seem like viable options, we need to start linearly solving problems. This is done by isolating the variable by doing the same things on both sides of the equation

Linear solving - isolating the variable by performing the same operations on both sides of the equation


Example

V =  13.5 +1.25t
A particle travels in a straight line at a constant speed of 13.5 meters per second. When the particle begins a constant acceleration of 1.25 meters per second, the particle travels at a velocity of v meters per second at time t seconds as shown in the given equation. What is t when v is 58.3?
A - 13.5
B - 35.84
C - 57.44
D - 86.38

How to solve linearly. 
1. Plug in 58.3 for V since that's when you want to know T
2. Subtract 13.5 from both sides
3. Divide by 1.25

# Inequalities

If you multiply or divide an inequality by a negative number, flip the sign


# Fractions on the SAT
- you DO NOT need to simplify fractions on SAT fill in questions unless you dont have enough space

Here you would want to cross multiply, since plugging in takes a lot of time.

# Absolute value

Distributing here isnt possible due to the absolute value bars. However, you can subtract them into 6|1-x|=42, since the things within the abs val bars are the same. Now dividing by 6, (giving us |1-x| = 7) we can fill in the variable with either positive or negative solution (depending on what the question asks for) and determine that our answer in this scenario is 8.
